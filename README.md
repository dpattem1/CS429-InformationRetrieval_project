# Text Processing System Project Report

## Abstract

**Development Summary**: The system being developed will be a highly complex one that will involve web scraping, text indexing, query processing, and other mechsmns. Its main emphasis rests on effective and smart rendering of the web page material information.


**Objectives**:

- Create a crawler that puts together such documents.

- Construct TF-IDF inflector to library the information.

- Design a Flask-based query processor that will handle searches and lunge up data that is relevant.


**Next Steps**:

- Improve the query processing by bringing the using of advanced natural language processing features.

- Scale the system to processing bigger data input.

- Make the user interface better in order to play with users’ experience.


## Overview


**Solution Outline**: Here, a Scrapy web crawler, an indexer built on Scikit-Learn, and a Flask server are integrated to create a complete system for interviewing and/or extracting needed information from a internet documents repository.


**Relevant Literature**: The design considerations emphasized efficiency and scalability, which were informed by the ongoing and recent developments in information retrieval studies.


**Proposed System**: This system should be modular and successfully scalable. It could as well be useful in academic scientific research as well as the production of commercial search engines.


## Design


**System Capabilities**:

- Robust web crawling.

- Text indexing made easier with the TF-IDF approach.

- Switching to adaptive querying where results are obtained by relevance.


**Interactions**:

- Stakeholders can go about their business in terms of querying them through an online user interface.

- Systems layer to chill through API calls and which are united by data-sharing.


**Integration**:

- Integrating various sets of technologies (Scrapy, Scikit-Iearn, and Flask) orients the system smoothly and boost the performance.


## Architecture


**Software Components**:

- **Web Crawler**: Specifies domains to fetch its data for query from through Scrapy.

- **Indexer**: Block-quotes Scikit-Learn for the production of a TF-IDF matrix and document indexing.

- **Query Processor**: A Flask User Interface offers a REST (Representational State Transfer) based API to submit search queries for receiving the results.


**Interfaces**:

- REST API which will be used to search function.

- Command Line Interface for Command and Control for crawler and indexer.


**Implementation**:

- Python-supervised implementation supported by a group of good repositories.


## Operation


**Software Commands**:

- ``python crawler.py`` to run the web crawler.

- Run `python indexer.py` to index the content.

- `flask run` command to launch the embedded Flask web server.


**Inputs**:

- The crawler usually starts with a list of start URLs, which can come from web directories, search engine queries or links from related websites.

- The indexer processes text data that the understanding stems from.

- The query processor is the component that receives user commands when the user sends a JSON request.


**Installation**:

- This tool necessitates Python version 3.10 and above, Flask version 2.2 and later, Scrapy version 2.11 and later, and Scikit-Learn version 1.2 and above.

- NODEPS CAN BE INSTALLED WITH pip install -r requirements.txt.


## Conclusion


**Results**: By means of the system it is possible to index the web pages and to browse the information under the keywords of users’ requests.


**Outputs**: Document delivery in ranked list form is provided for the users determined by relevance of queries.


**Caveats/Cautions**: Essentially it's being run through the traditional software architecture that is not able to cope with the current speed of real-time analytics on big datasets.


## Data Sources


**Links, Downloads, Access Information**:

- Data is sourced from web documents, specifically from [W3C HTML4 Links Structure](https:Every modern web page includes anchor elements that allow users to navigate to different locations within the same document and to link to external resources.

## Test Cases


**Framework**: Applies Pytest for the testing of the backend area. Essay Question: Discuss the role of media in shaping public opinion. The media plays a significant role in shaping public opinion.

**Harness**: It is designed to provide you with the full functionality such as cone, web indexing, and search server.

**Coverage**: The mission is to hit the 80% mark of code coverage.


## Source Code


**Listings**: It is a factor that affects an individual's pleasure from the increasing technology levels.
